# MoCap Setup

## Existing Setup Documentation

There should be thorough documentation for using the RPL motion capture (MoCap) system at
[KTH CAS RPL UAV Internal](https://www.kth.se/social/group/cas-rpl-uav-internal/).

This page is restricted, so you will need to request access from an administrator.

The information *may* have been made publicly available to all KTH account holders,
in which case it would be found at
[KTH CAS RPL UAV Public](https://www.kth.se/social/group/cas-rpl-uav-public/).
