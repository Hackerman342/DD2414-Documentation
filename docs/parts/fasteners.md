# Fasteners Summary

There are some specific fastener sizes that will be required for assembly
of this quadrotor as designed.

In general, it is recommended to have a decent stock
of fasteners (screws, washers, & nuts) of various size
& length, especially M3, M4, & M5.
For some screws, the head type (e,g phillips, torx, etc.)
may be noted, but following these recommendations is not necessary.
Also, the lengths are what worked for us, but should be viewed
as recommendations and not strict requirements.
You should purchase a pack of various screw sizes / lengths
and use what works best for you.

It is also recommended to have various sizes of zipties on hand.
The zipties are especially important to have in stock as they may break during
flights/collisions or will need to be cut & replaced when working on some
of the drone's components.

Finally, you should have a roll of double sided industrial foam tape or a few sheets
of double sided industrial pads. These are used to secure some of the smaller components
and are used to aid in securing some larger components.
