# Fasteners Summary

There are some specific fastener sizes that will be required for assembly
of this quadrotor as designed.

In general, it is recommended to have a decent stock
of fasteners (screws, washers, & nuts) of various size
& length, especially M3, M4, & M5.

It is also recommended to have various sizes of zipties on hand.
The zipties are especially important to have in stock as they may break during
flights/collisions or will need to be cut & replaced when working on some
of the drone's components.

Finally, you should have a roll of double sided industrial foam tape or a few sheets
of double sided industrial pads. These are used to secure some of the smaller components
and are used to aid in securing some larger components.
