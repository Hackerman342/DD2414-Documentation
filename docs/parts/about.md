# Parts Summary
The drone assembly requires a combination of purchased parts,
custom designed 3D printed parts, and custom made cabling.
This page details all necessary parts and how they can be obtained.
If you are assembling this drone for the KTH CAS-UAV lab, you should
check all inventory prior to making any purchase orders as some parts
are likely already be on hand.
