# Parts
The drone assembly requires a combination of purchased parts,
custom designed 3D printed parts, and custom made cabling.
This page details all necessary parts and how they can be obtained.
If you are assembling this drone for the KTH CAS-UAV lab, you should
check all inventory prior to making any purchase orders as some parts
are likely already be on hand.

#### Notes
 1. Purchase at least 5 motors in case one is damaged or fails (somewhat likely).
 2. Purchase at least 12 ESC's in case some fail / burn up (very likely).
    1. Technically the recommended motors can draw > 30 A, but shouldn't under the design conditions.
    2. Additionally, 40 A ESC's are excessively heavy and more expensive.
 3. Purchase around 10 packs of blades (4 per pack) as any collisions may result in damaged propellers that require replacement.
