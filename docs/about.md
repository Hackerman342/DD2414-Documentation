research drone platform tailored towards indoor navigation.
    + A. Mechanical design, sourcing, and construction of drone platform.
    + B. Electrical design, sourcing, and integration of all components.
     C. Software integration of low level firmware (PX4) and ROS.
2. Documentation of project
    + A. Project planning and management through task tracking with agile development.
    + B. Motivation of design choices.
    + C. Documentation of the final platform in the form of a comprehensive usage guide.
3. Work in collaboration with other group members and supervisors (PhD students and
Professors).
#### Primary ILO:
1. As a group, choose a course of approach and define, follow and follow up a plan for carrying
out a larger project task in a given resource budget.
2. Systematically design, implement, test and demonstrate a prototype system that meets given
specifications and design goals.
3. Present orally and in writing (in English), a description and defense of a technical solution to
a problem in robotics, perception and learning.
4. Be able to participate professionally in project work in activities in robotics, perception and
learning.
####Secondary ILO:
1. Implement and integrate a number of important tools and technologies used in robotics.
2. Be able to assess the value of, and to a suitable extent utilize, existing solutions as a part of a
robotics project.
3. Use adequate engineering tools and methods and acquire new knowledge and skill when
needed.
