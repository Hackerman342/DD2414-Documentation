Documentation of project A. Project planning and management through task tracking with agile development. B. Motivation of design choices. C. Documentation of the final platform in the form of a comprehensive usage guide. Work in collaboration with other group members and supervisors (PhD students and Professors). Primary ILO: As a group, choose a course of approach and define, follow and follow up a plan for carrying out a larger project task in a given resource budget. Systematically design, implement, test and demonstrate a prototype system that meets given specifications and design goals. Present orally and in writing (in English), a description and defense of a technical solution to a problem in robotics, perception and learning. Be able to participate professionally in project work in activities in robotics, perception and learning. Secondary ILO: Implement and integrate a number of important tools and technologies used in robotics. Be able to assess the value of, and to a suitable extent utilize, existing solutions as a part of a robotics project. Use adequate engineering tools and methods and acquire new knowledge and skill when needed.","title":"About"},{"location":"about/#autumn-2020","text":"Students: Luis Alejandro Sarmiento Gonzalez lasg@kth.se Kyle Coble coble@kth.se Course responsible & supervisors: Patric Jensfelt Ludvig Ericson Daniel Duberg Goal: Design and build a serviceable research drone platform tailored towards indoor navigation.","title":"Autumn 2020"},{"location":"about/#syllabus","text":"Plan, design, source, integrate, and implement a robotic solution in the form of a serviceable research drone platform tailored towards indoor navigation.
